# saltant

**saltant** at its core is a
[Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery)-powered [Django
app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/applications/) for
running and managing asynchonous tasks with the philosophy that when you
update your task code, you should **never** have to restart your job
queue/workers, or migrate your backend's database. It's a great solution
for an ever-changing code base when downtime is expensive.

## Origin

>  /ˈsæl tnt/
>
> a mutant individual or strain; especially: one produced in a fungal or
> bacterial culture

saltant is a mutant strain of
[Tantalus](https://github.com/shahcompbio/tantalus), which served a dual
role as a task runner (just like saltant) and as a genomics
file/metadata database for the [Shah Lab](http://shahlab.ca/) at [BC
Cancer](http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/). The problem with Tantalus was that
tasks needed frequent updating, and that ever-changing server
infrastructure required changes in to the job infrastructure—both of
which usually meant bringing the backend down. When the backend went
down to sort out task problems, the file/metadata database part had to
go down too. Therefore there was much to be gained from decoupling the job
system from the file/metadata database system. Hence, saltant.

Soon!
